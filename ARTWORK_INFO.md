## Artist Statement

My work investigates how women's bodies become sites of emotional governance, where pain, discipline, and transformation are moralized and socially coded. I use everyday objects, beds, chairs, pillows, garments, as metaphors for endurance, containment, and relational spaces.

Painting is integral to my practice: through transparency, erasure, repetition, and layered surfaces, I allow the canvas to become an archive, a memory, and a testimony. At the same time, I explore how different media articulate meaning in distinct ways.

Grounded in cross-cultural perspectives, my art highlights both shared human experiences and cultural specificities in how bodies, identities, and emotional regimes are constructed.
