## 🎨 About the Artist

My work investigates how women's bodies become sites of emotional governance—where pain, discipline, and transformation are moralized and socially coded. I use everyday objects—beds, chairs, pillows, garments—as metaphors for endurance, containment, and relational spaces.

Painting is integral to my practice: through transparency, erasure, repetition, and layered surfaces, I allow the canvas to become an archive, a memory, and a testimony.
